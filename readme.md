Katherine (Katie) Ferro is a student studying informatics and Chinese laguage at Indiana University. She enrolled at Indiana University in Fall 2019. During
this time, she was an International Studies and Chinese language student. However, she quickly found that International Studies is incredibly arduous and boring.
Which lead her to search into a different endeavor. Ever since she was in high school, she enjoyed learning languages. She studied Spanish, German , Hebrew and Chinese during her 
time in high school. With the management skills of learning all these languages in such a short period of time, Katie overestimated her abilities.
Her original goal involved the mastery of Chinese, Japanese, Korean and Russian. She hoped to achieve fluenct in these 4 languages in the span of four years. Barring the 
consequences of covid, this task is nearly impossible even with all the right tools. She was encouraged to pick a single language and master that one. She ended up choosing Chinese
due to the sheer amount of people who speak it.
